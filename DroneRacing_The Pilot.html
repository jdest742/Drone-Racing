<div style="width:70%"><p>While the pilot <strong>always</strong> requires goggles, some drone racing organizations insist they should also be used among spectators alike.<br>
Any drone could be used to race, however competitive FPV racing leagues require drones to meet certain standards. <br>The <strong><a href="http://thedroneracingleague.com/">Drone Racing League (DRL)</a></strong> makes all of the drones used in its events in house; pilots are supplied with drones, backup drones, and parts by the league itself, not independently.
<br><br>In contrast MultiGP, defines community produced specifications and allows participants to supply their own drones, increasing competitiveness and innovation. <br>For competition, aircraft are typically separated into classes, separating winged craft from rotorcraft; and also categorising by size and power.
