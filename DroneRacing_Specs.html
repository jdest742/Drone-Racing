<blockquote>
<div style="width:70%"><p>Racing drones are designed to focus all of their energy into moving <em>forward</em>, as opposed to a photography/video drone which is focused more on hovering.
<br>A photography quadcopter design will typically have four blades configured in an <em>X-pattern</em>, all equally spaced apart. 
A racing model will typically have its four blades configured in an H-pattern configured to thrust the drone forward, not up. 
<article>Because of their light weight and electric motors with large amounts of torque, drones can accelerate and maneuver with great speed and agility.<article>
This makes for very sensitive controls and requires a pilot with quick reaction times and a steady hand.</p></div>
